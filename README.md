# Mobile Banking Adoption in Emerging Economies

This project investigates mobile banking adoption patterns across **Pakistan**, **India**, and **Kenya** using synthetic data modeled on the **World Bank Global Findex 2021**. The aim is to understand what factors influence digital banking behavior in emerging markets using **machine learning and classification techniques**.

---

## Project Overview

- Analyze how demographic, financial, and geographic factors affect mobile banking usage
- Apply ML models to predict mobile banking adoption
- Compare feature importance and model performance
- Relate results to published academic literature and real-world trends

## Methods Used

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Label Encoding
  - Feature Scaling
  - SMOTE for class balancing

- **Models Applied**:
  - `Logistic Regression`
  - `Random Forest Classifier`
  - `XGBoost Classifier`

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
 
  | Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
  |---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
  | Logistic Regression | 0.76     | 0.66      | **0.84** | 0.74   |
  | Random Forest       | **0.76** | 0.71      | 0.69   | 0.70     |
  | XGBoost             | 0.75     | **0.71**  | 0.66   | 0.68     |

## Key Insights

- üáµüá∞ **Pakistan**: Highest adoption (~39.5%), driven by platforms like Easypaisa and JazzCash.  
- üá∞üá™ **Kenya**: ~37.5% adoption, aligned with M-Pesa‚Äôs mobile money dominance.  
- üáÆüá≥ **India**: ~37.25%, backed by UPI, Aadhaar and financial inclusion schemes.

> ‚ÄúOwns_Account‚Äù was the strongest predictor of mobile banking usage across all models.
